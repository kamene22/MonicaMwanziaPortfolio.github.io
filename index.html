									<a href="https://github.com/kamene22/DATA-CLEANING-IN-SQL" class="image fit"><img src="images/housing.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									In this project, I undertook the task of making housing data more suitable for analysis by utilizing SQL Server. By employing various data cleaning techniques, such as standardizing dates, filling missing addresses, splitting address fields, converting values, and removing duplicates, I transformed the raw housing dataset into a clean and organized format. This process ensured that the data was optimized for analysis, enabling efficient and accurate insights to be extracted</p>

									<pSales Analysis Project:

									<p></p>In this sales analysis project, 
									I begin by meticulously cleaning the data, removing NaN values, eliminating rows based on specific conditions
									 and transforming column types. Once the data is cleansed, I delve into the exploration phase, 
									 addressing five key business questions. 
									 These include identifying the best month for sales and its corresponding revenue, 
									 pinpointing the top-selling city, determining the optimal timing for effective advertisements, 
									 analyzing frequently co-purchased products, and identifying the best-selling product and its contributing factors. 
									 To answer these questions,
									  I employ pandas and matplotlib methods such as concatenating CSVs, adding columns, parsing strings, 
									  applying functions, using groupby for aggregate analysis, and visualizing results with bar charts 
									  and line graphs while ensuring clear labeling for enhanced understanding. Throughout this project,
									   I maintain a high level of professionalism and attention to detail to derive meaningful insights
									 and deliver actionable recommendations.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">PRICING CORPRATE DEBT USING MERTONS MODEL<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/project.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This report investigates the risk of default of Safaricom PLC on its bonds by looking at its credit spread.
										 The aim of the project is to use the Merton’s Model to model the market value of the company’s security,
										  to estimate the probability of default on debt and to calculate the credit spread. 
										  The model has an appealing feature of connecting credit risk 
										  to underlying variables providing an intuitive economic interpretation
										   and a lengthy explanation of credit defaults. 
										   The discussion focuses on helping corporate entities in developing 
										   and improving on their credit spread policies and financial structures. 
										   Bond market investors can also use its derivatives to come up with hedging strategies. 
										   In conclusion, this study aims at helping investors make informed decisions regarding 
										   their investments by maximizing profits and incurring minimum or no losses.
										   Recently due to  COVID 19 and the state  Economy, 
										   the Kenyan financial sector has witnessed the collapse of firms due to their inability to meet their financial
										    and legal debt obligations. 
											Therefore, it is crucial to price this corporate debt to avoid losses caused by default.
										This my final year school project, I'm working towards publishing it. </p>
